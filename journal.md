<h1>July 18th</h1>
Today, I picked out parts and the mechanics as well as thought about the overall design. I made sure to allocate enough for decent laser goggles and an enclosure which I plan to be fully solid plastic with a small square cut out the top with a (1"x1") laser safe acrylic piece which you can check on the cutter through.
After that, I started work on the CAD, finishing the y-axis.

I spent a bit researching laser cutters, diode lasers, and movement systems which gave me a new perspective towards the machine.

I decided to go with a sturdier type of build because I want it to last a long time. I'll be using it to cut things like thin wood. It also has PWM control for the laser so engraving still is possible even with the sturdy leadscrew system. 

Total Time Spent: ~4 Hours
