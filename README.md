# 5W-Laser-Cutter
A 5-Watt diode laser engraver/cutter that can cut thin basswood, plywood, balsa, dark acrylic, leather, foamboard, and cardboard. It can engrave a huge amount of things, including most woods, soft metals, leathers, rubbers, and plastics!



It has many robust features, such as 0.9 stepper motors, laser head air assist, an opaque ventilated enclosure with a small laser-safe acrylic window, and a control box with lots of safety features!



<h1>Laser Safety</h1>

** Make sure to ALWAYS buy laser goggles from a reputable brand and with properly rated specifications. **

** Lasers are extremely dangerous and you should never look at them directly and always wear proper safety goggles. **

** I am not responsible for any damage caused from irresponsibly using lasers. ** 

**General Tips for Working with Lasers:**

* The glasses that come with lasers are NOT safe, and will not protect your eyes.

* Lasers over 5mW require proper laser goggles, 5mW is still dangerous however the blink reflex protects you in most cases.

* Cutting with lasers releases fumes which need to be filtered or ventilated to a window, preferably both.

* An enclosure is the BARE minimum for safety along with properly rated laser goggles.

* Do LOTS of research before working with lasers. Diode lasers need to be treated very carefully especially.

<h3>With that done, let me show you the good stuff. (Disclaimer: The enclosure is NOT made of glass- that is purely for viewing purposes.) </h3>
