<h1>Laser Safety</h1>

** Make sure to ALWAYS buy laser goggles from a reputable brand and with properly rated specifications. **

Lasers are extremely dangerous and you should never look at them directly and always wear proper safety goggles. 

** I am not responsible for any damage caused from irresponsibly using lasers. ** 

**General Tips for Working with Lasers:**

* The glasses that come with lasers are NOT safe, and will not protect your eyes.

* Lasers over 5mW require proper laser goggles, 5mW is still dangerous however the blink reflex protects you in most cases.

* Cutting with lasers releases fumes which need to be filtered or ventilated to a window, preferably both.

* An enclosure is the BARE minimum for safety along with properly rated laser goggles.

* Do LOTS of research before working with lasers. Diode lasers need to be treated very carefully especially.
